  "Greeting": "\nGreetings and welcome to Tochka,\n\nwe hope your stay here is as friendly and welcoming as possible. Here at Tochka we aim to please our users and we strive to provide an amazing market experience. If you ever have ANY questions, need help with a dispute, or maybe you're having problems editing a listing of yours-- I'm always a message away. With that being said, here's a quick run down of Tochka, some features and quick list of rules.\n\nTochka Features:\n- Multiple vendor accounts, ranging from free (limited to 5 listings, higher comission rate, etc) to $100 USD. You can find more information about the different types of accounts here: http://tochka3evlj3sxdv.onion/account\n\n- Referrals can earn you money! Every member that you refer, using the referral system (http://tochka3evlj3sxdv.onion/referrals), will earn you money every time they place an order. You will receive a percentage, based off of the total amount of the order from the referred user, plus the account type you have. \n\n- Friendly staff is one of our biggest features, as we strive to provide a friendly and mature relationship with our users, no matter if they are a customer who's never bought a single item or a vendor who sells a million items a day. Everyone is treated EQUAL here at Tochka. Should you ever need help, you can always visit the support page (http://tochka3evlj3sxdv.onion/support) or message one of the staff members, someone should always be available to help.\n\nTochka Rules:\n- No scamming. We will not and do not tolerate any type of scamming of our users or of the market itself. All scammers will be banned immediately. \n\n- Please read our help section BEFORE you start listings items -- just so you the user are clear on what here at Tochka allow and do not allow to be sold on the market. \n\n- Be friendly. Our staff works very hard, with that said sometimes people get short tempered, which  doesn't help us any nor does it help you! Our goal here is to provide a friendly marketplace that everyone can feel at home with. Kindness goes a long ways!\n\nWith that being said, if you need any help whatsoever, feel free to contact support. Please try to refrain from sending multiple messages about the same subject, if we haven't answered yet, it's because we are hard at work trying to answer questions that arrived before yours. You WILL be answered as quickly as possible. \n\nEnjoy your stay here at Tochka!\n",
  "TrustedVendor": "- Sign Marketplace rules with your PGP key and post it to Trusted Vendor Verification thread\n\n- Upload images of items you're selling to Trusted Vendor Verification thread (images must contain your username or site name written on piece of paper)\n\n- When you're ready, press 'Request Trusted Vendor Status' button and our staff will contact you for further actions"
