# Tochka Vendor Levels

Tochka utilizies vendor level system to improve quality of operations, reduce fraud and encourage fair deals.

10 successful deals = 1 level
6 month on marketplace = 2x multiplier (you get 2 levels per deal)
1 unsolved warning = -10 levels

## Vendor accounts
There's four different levels for vendor accounts.
* Gold
* Silver
* Bronze
* Free

Each with a larger up-front investment for the vendor, but with greater value in the long-run.
