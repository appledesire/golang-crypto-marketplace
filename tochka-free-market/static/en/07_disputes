# Tochka Dispute Policy 

The Tochka Dispute Policy will work as terms & conditions for every order on the Tochka Free Market excluding orders were the vendor set-up his own terms & conditions. The terms & conditions of the vendor are overwritten if they violate any rule of the Tochka Free Market. 

### Each dispute is unique
We work to create a policy on which we will decide disputes but as each dispute is unique, we won't be able to handle one dispute like another. 

### Transparency
We will discuss any decision made on a dispute, in dispute you feel mistreated by the Tochka Staff.
